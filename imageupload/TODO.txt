List of things that still need to be done for project
What needs to be done:
  Aesthetic stuff:
  Firefox css problem //fixed, but can someone test on different browsers/ resolutions, iv only tested on my laptop with firefox and chrome on a fairly standard size
  maybe centre the whole page, atm it sits on the left //done, see if you guys like it in centre or not.
  add tab logo //added 


  Users:
  at the moment when a user logs in they are able to navigate to another users images, and upload edit and delete as that other user. obviously yths shouldnt happen.
  Sign-up:


  Geolocation of photos:
  Does somebody want to have a look at how to do this?



Possible changes:

  Users:
  When a user logs in they currently get directed to a list of users, should they instead go to their profile

  Should users have an avatar? and if they do will they require one to sign up?
