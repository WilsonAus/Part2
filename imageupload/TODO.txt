List of things that still need to be done for project

From Project Spec
Baseline (85%)

The system should:

  allow a user to create an account and login to the system // ✓ few minor tweaks required
  allow registered users to upload photos // ✓
  automatically resize the images into the following sizes: thumbnail, small, medium, large (you can decided the actual dimensions for each size); // think this still needs to be done, saw something along these lines coming along somewhere though
  allow public users browse each users photos in a gallery format // i think she meant public users /to/ browse, but you never know.  anyway i think she means allow public users and site users to browse photos in a gallery format. anyway this is sort of already done, but at the moment they can also edit the photos, which needs to be taken away.

Full marks (100%)

The system

  should allow users to become friends and allow users to set photos to private, which only allows the users friends to view the photos (5%): //need to work out how to do this
  have complete unit and functional/integrations tests (10%) // don't really know what this means

Bonus marks (110%)

  the system should attempt to geo-tag photos that get uploaded, by using either the new HTML 5 Geo API (8%). //gotta look into this. it says using either, then gives one option so im not too sure if this is the only way to do it, because it can be done with cookies 
              //just messing around with the html5 geo stuff, chrome seems to really not like it, firstly you have to share location and sometimes it just doesnt, seems to work a bit better in firefox, but it somehow managed to crash it once.. 
              // http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp 

                using cookies :
                            def lat_lng
                                 @lat_lng ||= session[:lat_lng] ||= get_geolocation_data_the_hard_way
                            end

            
  Building the site using HTML5 and CSS3 is worth an additional 2%. // ✓ pretty easy 2% here, especially since part 1 was already in html5 and css3, dont really know why anyone would use anything else..












What needs to be done:
  Aesthetic stuff:
  Firefox css problem //fixed, but can someone test on different browsers/ resolutions, iv only tested on my laptop with firefox and chrome on a fairly standard size
  Breaks when user clicks sign up with no info, i can fix this by just making it a bit longer, but might be too long for pages with barely anything.
  maybe centre the whole page, atm it sits on the left //done, see if you guys like it in centre or not.
  add tab logo //added 
  Notifications, kinda look scrappy atm, have to fix them and make them look nicer, possibly have a popup instead


  Users:
  at the moment when a user logs in they are able to navigate to another users images, and upload edit and delete as that other user. obviously yths shouldnt happen.
  Sign-up:


  Geolocation of photos:
  Does somebody want to have a look at how to do this?



Possible changes:

  Users:
  When a user logs in they currently get directed to a list of users, should they instead go to their profile

  Should users have an avatar? and if they do will they require one to sign up?
